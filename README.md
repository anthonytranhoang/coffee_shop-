## Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of sales data from a coffee shop, focusing on identifying peak sales hours, understanding customer purchasing behavior, and optimizing product offerings. The analysis specifically covers sales trends during key hours (6 AM - 12 PM), the busiest period for many coffee shops.

## Key Features
Hourly Sales Breakdown: A detailed examination of sales trends across different hours of the day, with a particular focus on morning peak hours (6 AM - 12 PM).

Product Analysis: Insights into the best-selling items during peak periods, helping to identify which products drive the most revenue.

Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize sales performance, making it easy to spot patterns and peaks in customer activity.

Actionable Insights: Suggestions for improving sales strategies, such as promotions, staffing adjustments, and inventory management, based on peak and off-peak hour data.

## Files and Structure
/data/: Contains raw sales data in CSV format, including details like timestamps, item descriptions, and total sales.

/scripts/: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries).

/reports/: Summary reports of the findings, including graphs and key insights from the analysis.

## Future Improvements
Expanding the time range for analysis to capture full-day sales trends.

Incorporating customer demographics to segment sales by age, gender, or other factors.

Adding a machine learning model to predict future sales trends based on historical data.
